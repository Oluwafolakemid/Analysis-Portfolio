ðŸš€ How to Use This Portfolio

Feel free to explore any project you're interested in. Each one is designed to be understandable on its own, with a business case, technical workflow, and conclusions.

If you're a recruiter or collaborator, I'm open to feedback and new ideas. You can contact me via LinkedIn or check out individual project READMEs for more details.
